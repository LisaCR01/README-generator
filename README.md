# README Generator
In this project I created a command line application that dynamically generates a professional README file from a user's input called 'README-generated'. The motivation for this project is to allow creators to devote more time to working on the project than formatting their README file. I used the 'Professional README Guide' format to create the a polished appearance for the generated README. The main learning points for me of this projects is the use of package.json and its dependencies and using a .gitignore file to make sure pm dependencies aren't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. 

## Technologies Used
* Inquirer package
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Node.js
* JSON

## Criteria that I Met to Achieve this
* When the user answers command line prompts a high-quality, professional README.md is generated.
* When the user enters a project title this is displayed as their README title
* When the user enters details for sections they are added to the corresponding sections of the README.
* When the user choses a license for their application then a badge appears at the top of the README and a notice is added to the license section.
* When the user enters their GitHub username then a link to it is added to the Questions section of the README.
* When the user enters their email this is added to the Questions section of the README for how to reach them.
* When the user click on the links in the Table of Contents they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
